## Everything Variables
There are 3 ways to declare variables
1. using *var* keyword  - prefer not using var keyword due to block scope & functional scope issues, can be        reassigned
    Syntax: var user_name = "SR"
2. using *let* keyword - can be reassigned, block scoped, mostly used
    Syntax: let user_name = "SR";
3. using *const* keyword - cannot be reassigned, block scoped, mostly used
    Syntax: const user_name = "SR";
