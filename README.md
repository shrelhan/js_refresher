# What is JavaScript ?
*JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.*

## Everything Variables
There are 3 ways to declare variables
1. using *var* keyword  - prefer not using var keyword due to block scope & functional scope issues, can be        reassigned
    Syntax: var user_name = "SR"
2. using *let* keyword - can be reassigned, block scoped, mostly used
    Syntax: let user_name = "SR";
3. using *const* keyword - cannot be reassigned, block scoped, mostly used
    Syntax: const user_name = "SR";
